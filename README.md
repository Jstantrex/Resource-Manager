# Resource Manager

A Fantasy Grounds Extension for managing Limited Use Features in Pathfinder 1E. Based on the 5E expansion Capital Gains by MeAndUnique.

In Pathfinder 1E, the generally accepted way to handle Limited Use Features such as Barbarian's Rage and Gunslinger's Grit is to create a spell class with first level spell slots equal to the number of uses, then change the spellcasting type to spontaneous.  This allows you to track uses using the dots to the side of the "Spell".

This takes up a lot of room and is very unintuitive.

Using Resource Manager will allow you to track many more Limited Use Features in a much smaller, easier to use format.
